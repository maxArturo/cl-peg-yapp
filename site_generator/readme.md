# static site generation

this is an attempt at creating a hand-wavy site generator that is
compatible with roughly what Jekyll expects and my own personal
zettelkasten note setup.

It should also be interesting how far I can get with the whole
procedural development that Lisp espouses.

let's get some general things out the way. the way Jekyll expects thins
is the following:

## features

- static site generation
- routing for each markdown file, following the folder/file pattern
- config with a `site.toml` file
- \[optional\] spit out a tags page so people can find stuff easily
- link from one page to another easily in the same markdown

### front matter

I want my landing page to look like this:

    [right side]    [left side]
    title           folder_1 folder_2 folder_3 more...
    [optional header]
    center matter
    [optional footer]

in the file `site.toml` add some config for

- site title (default: your folder name)
- landing page markdown file (default: first markdown of the first
  folder we find or the first markdown we find)
- 404 file (default: autogenerated one)
- optional header matter
- optional footer matter

### posts

filename is `2015-07-12-Ive-quit-reddit-and-why.md` so there's some
metadata here. But I think it might be easier to use the actual markdown
so that we can keep config by page/post. So then, if the file contents
is:

    ---
    date: some_date
    title: some_title
    tags: cars potatoes people_am_i_right
    ---
    # Here is my header

    [some markdown goes here]

    ## some other sub header

    [even more markdown]

thats one thing jekyll did well.

## TODO

- use asdf:

``` lisp
(asdf:defsystem "hello-lisp"
  :description "hello-lisp: a sample Lisp system."
    :version "0.0.1"
    :author "Joe User <joe@example.com>"
    :licence "Public Domain"
    :components ((:file "packages")
        (:file "macros" :depends-on ("packages"))
        (:file "hello"  :depends-on ("macros"))))
```
