;; a plist is a property list, with symbols and alternating data.

;; (defvar *some-local-var*  (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3))

;; you can get the data from here, with `getf`. A poor man's hash table of sorts.

;; (getf *some-local-var* :c)

;; let's start making some data.

(defun make-post (title content points date)
    (list 
         :title title 
         :content content 
         :points points
         :date date))

(make-post "sample title" "sample content" 18 "2023-08-15")

;; let's make a db var that holds everything
(defvar *db* nil)

;; and let's add a function that handles the adding of things
(defun add-post (post) (push post *db*))

;; now we can add posts to our db
(add-post (make-post "some title" "some content" 18 "2023-08-15")) 
(add-post (make-post "new title" "new content" 42 "2023-08-15")) 
(add-post (make-post "second title" "second content" 18 "2023-08-15")) 
(add-post (make-post "third title" "third content" 38 "2023-08-15")) 


;; let's make the output look nice

(defun dump-db () 
    (dolist (cd *db*) (format t "岷卑酤狺%" cd)))
(dump-db)

;; t is shorthand for the stream *standard-output*.
;; The t directive is for tabulating. The 10t tells FORMAT to 
;; emit enough spaces to move to the tenth column before processing 
;; the next a. A t doesn't consume any arguments. 

;; CL-USER> (format t "a:10ta" :artist "Dixie Chicks")
;; ARTIST:   Dixie Chicks
;; NIL
;; 
;; Now things get slightly more complicated. When FORMAT sees 换翳铄狎珲礤铘麸忮泔铙蹴邃眭篝忮扉篝葡彝猎祜镳换秭弪翳狒扉篝痱镢弩箝铉翳溟蝈泗轹弩忮赭邋翳犷换, consuming as many elements of the list as needed each 
;; time through the list. In dump-db, the FORMAT loop will consume 
;; one keyword and one value from the list each time through the 
;; loop. The % directive doesn't consume any arguments but tells 
;; FORMAT to emit a newline. Then after the } ends the loop, the 
;; last % tells FORMAT to emit one more newline to put a blank 
;; line between each CD.
;; 
;; Technically, you could have also used FORMAT to loop over the database itself, turning our dump-db function into a one-liner.
;; 
;; (defun dump-db ()
;;     (format t "岷卑酤狺%}" *db*))
;; 
;; That's either very cool or very scary depending on your point of view. 

;; oh boy. now lets do user interaction.

;; note that The variable *query-io* is a global variable 
;; (which you can tell because of the * naming convention for global variables)
;; that contains the input stream connected to the terminal.

(defun prompt-read (prompt) 
  (format *query-io* "a: " prompt)
  (force-output *query-io*) ; needed in some implementations to make sure we
                            ; don't wait for newline before printing
  (read-line *query-io*))

;; now we can build and store an entire record.
(defun prompt-post ()
  (make-post 
    (prompt-read "title")
    (prompt-read "content")
    ;; except the madeup field points is an int - and we read in strings.    
    ;; so we need to coerce that with: 
    (or (parse-integer (prompt-read "points") :junk-allowed t) 0) ;or returns NIL 
                                                                  ;if given junk  
    (prompt-read "date")))

;; finally we can wrap it all in a loop-based multirecord until the user
;; wants to stop.

(defun prompt-multi-posts ()
  (loop (add-post (prompt-post))
        (if (not (y-or-n-p "Another? [y/n]: ")) 
            (return))))

;; Let's save this DB.
(defun save-db (&key (filename "posts.db")) ; ensures provided by keys
                                            ; also "posts.db" is default
  (with-open-file (out filename 
                       :direction :output
                       :if-exists :supersede)
    (with-standard-io-syntax (print *db* out))))

;; we can also load it back!

(defun load-db (&rest filename) 
  "loads the db of posts. Default db location is `posts.db`"
  (with-open-file (in (or (car filename) "posts.db"))
    (with-standard-io-syntax (setf *db* (read in)))))

;; now we're building a querying language for this (for the sake
;; of practice. 

;; let's get a function that allows us to search for a particular field.
;; we need to use `getf` and the field we're looking for.
;; for example we want to see if a particular post has this title:

(equal "magical title" (getf *some-local-var* :a))
;; now we can treat the whole db as a list (inefficient but this is practice
;; ) and search for all the records that have the thing

;; (remove-if-not 
;;   (lambda (post) (equal (getf post :title) "hey")) 
;;   *db*)

;; now we can take all that as a higher order function
(defun select(selector) (remove-if-not selector *db*))

;; and now we write a post tile-specific selector: 
(defun select-by-title (title) 
  (select(lambda (post) (equal title (getf post :title)))))

;; but now we want to ggenerate a bunch of these functions, each
;; with their own variation. With the only caveat that each look for
;; a particular field, and have a particular argument

;; this `where` works as in SQL, with implicit *and*
(defun where (&key title content (points nil points-p) date)
  (lambda (post) 
    (and 
      (if title (equal title (getf post :title)) t)
      (if content (equal content (getf post :content)) t)
      (if points-p (equal points (getf post :points)) t)
      (if date (equal date (getf post :date)) t))))

;; and yes, why not. Let's add update.
(defun update (selector-fn &key title content (points nil points-p) date) 
  (setf *db*
        (mapcar 
          (lambda (row) 
            (when (funcall selector-fn row)
               (if title (setf (getf row :title) title))
               (if content (setf (getf row :content) content))
               (if points-p (setf (getf row :points) points))
               (if date (setf (getf row :date) date)))
          row) 
         *db*)))
;; ooooo boy. macros


;; OK so let's remove repetition in *where*. Ideally we'd want to
;; make sure we only compare for the clauses and fields we're interested
;; in. 

;; To do so let's make a function that "writes" what we want
(defun make-comparison-expr (field value)
  `(equal ,value (getf post ,field)))

;; wow that's powerful
;; ok now let's put it all together
(defun make-comparison-list (fields)
  (loop while fields
        collecting (make-comparison-expr (pop fields) (pop fields))))

;; last thing remaining is to wrap everything in AND and you're set!
(defmacro where (&rest clauses) 
  `(lambda (post) (and ,@(make-comparison-list clauses))))

;; you can see what would come out with macroexpand-1

;; CL-USER> (macroexpand-1 '(where :title "yoo" :date "some date"))
;; (LAMBDA (POST)
;;   (AND (EQUAL "yoo" (GETF POST :TITLE)) (EQUAL "some date" (GETF POST :DATE))))
